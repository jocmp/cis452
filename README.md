### Plagiarism in Computer Science:

Plagiarism is the willful copying of words or ideas from a source without giving the author 
full credit for those words or ideas. The source may be your textbook, a web site, a CD-ROM,
an e-mail from a friend, conversations with individuals in the computer lab and other sources.

You avoid plagiarism by acknowledging the original author of any ideas you copy or receive 
significant inspiration from. This includes, for example, source code from textbooks, 
accompanying CD-ROMS, and web sites. Acknowledgment should be within the source code. 
Acknowledgment within other assignments such as reports should be done with endnotes. 
Consult with your instructor if you have any doubts on the legitimacy of a source.
